"""  Create synthetic images used to train the autoencoder. Images will be synthesized by different operations between data sets.

Parallelism performed using concurrent.futures (https://docs.python.org/3/library/concurrent.futures.html)

The nc file created has 32C2 images (496) with 5 variables, and coordinates for y and x.
